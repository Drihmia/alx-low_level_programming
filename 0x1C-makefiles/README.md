## General

In this project, the focus was on mastering the fundamentals of `make` and `Makefiles`, indispensable tools in the world of C programming. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts covered:

- **make and Makefiles:** Understanding the role of `make` and `Makefiles` in automating the compilation process in C programming.
  
- **Purpose and Utility of Makefiles:** Learning when, why, and how to utilize Makefiles to manage complex projects, streamline compilation, and handle dependencies effectively.

- **Rules:** Exploring the concept of rules in Makefiles and understanding how to define and utilize them to articulate the build process for the project.

- **Explicit and Implicit Rules:** Distinguishing between explicit and implicit rules and leveraging them effectively within Makefiles.

- **Common/Useful Rules:** Identifying and implementing common and useful rules such as `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `oclean`, and `re`, and understanding their functionalities within the Makefile.

- **Variables:** Learning about variables in Makefiles and how to set and use them to customize the build process according to project requirements.
