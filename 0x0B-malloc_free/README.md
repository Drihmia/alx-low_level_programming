## Objectives

Throughout this project, the primary objectives were:

- **Understanding Allocation Types:** Differentiating between automatic and dynamic allocation, including their characteristics, advantages, and use cases in C programming.

- **Memory Allocation Functions:** Mastery of the functions `malloc` and `free`, understanding their purposes, differences, and how to use them effectively for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C programming.

- **Usage of malloc:** Gaining insight into why and when to use `malloc` for dynamic memory allocation, understanding its importance in managing memory efficiently and avoiding common pitfalls such as memory leaks.

- **Memory Leak Detection:** Familiarization with the usage of Valgrind to check for memory leaks in C programs, understanding how to interpret Valgrind's output and address memory issues effectively.

# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

This directory contains solutions to tasks related to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C programming using `malloc` and `free`.

## Tasks:

1. [**0-create_array.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/0-create_array.c): A function that creates an array of characters, initializes it with a specific character.

2. [**1-strdup.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/1-strdup.c): A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

3. [**2-str_concat.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/2-str_concat.c): A function that concatenates two strings.

4. [**3-alloc_grid.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c): A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

5. [**3-main.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/3-main.c): A main function for testing `3-alloc_grid.c`.

6. [**4-free_grid.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/4-free_grid.c): A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `3-alloc_grid.c` function.

7. [**100-argstostr.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/100-argstostr.c): A function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

8. [**101-strtow.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/101-strtow.c): A function that splits a string into words.
