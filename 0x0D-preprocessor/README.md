## Objectives

Throughout this project, the primary objectives were:

- **Understanding Macros:** Mastery of macros, including their definition, usage, and practical applications in C programming. This includes knowing what macros are, how to define them, and how to use them effectively to enhance code readability and maintainability.

- **Predefined Macros:** Familiarization with the most common predefined macros in C programming, understanding their purposes and when to use them.

- **Header File Inclusion Guards:** Gaining proficiency in including guard your header files, a technique used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, ensuring that the declarations within are only included once in a translation unit.

This directory contains solutions to tasks related to the preprocessor directives in C programming.

## Tasks:

1. [**0-object_like_macro.h**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h): A header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

2. [**1-pi.h**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h): A header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

3. [**2-main.c**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c): A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

4. [**3-function_like_macro.h**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h): A function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

5. [**4-sum.h**](https://github.com/Drihmia/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h): A function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
